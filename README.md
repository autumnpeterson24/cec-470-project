Overview:
The problem chosen by the group is the comparison of speed and efficiency of four different string pattern recognition algorithms on two different architectures. The four different algorithms chosen are: Rabin-Karp, Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP), Finite Automata, and Boyer Moore. 

Each architecture will perform all four methods. Then, comparisons will be drawn between the two architectures by algorithm; each algorithmâ€™s processes will be analyzed and considered in the context of the architecture so that we can make conclusions about how the different architectures are handling/optimizing the algorithm. We can compare this with our expected results based on our knowledge of each architecture, even before running any tests. 

Each algorithm will be implemented using C++. A brief outline of each algorithm is provided below.
